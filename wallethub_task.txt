The goal is to write a parser in Java that parses web server access log file, loads the log to MySQL and checks if a given 
IP makes more than a certain number of requests for the given duration. 
Java
----
(1) Create a java tool that can parse and load the given log file to MySQL. The delimiter of the log file is pipe (|)
(2) The tool takes "startDate", "duration" and "threshold" as command line arguments. "startDate" is of "yyyy-MM-dd.HH:mm:ss" format, 
"duration" can take only "hourly", "daily" as inputs and "threshold" can be an integer.
(3) This is how the tool works:
java -cp "parser.jar" com.ef.Parser --startDate=2017-01-01.13:00:00 --duration=hourly --threshold=100
The tool will find any IPs that made more than 100 requests starting from 2017-01-01.13:00:00 to 2017-01-01.14:00:00 
(one hour) and print them to console AND also load them to another MySQL table with comments on 
why it's blocked.
java -cp "parser.jar" com.ef.Parser --startDate=2017-01-01.13:00:00 --duration=daily --threshold=250

The tool will find any IPs that made more than 250 requests starting from 2017-01-01.13:00:00 to 2017-01-02.13:00:00 
(24 hours) and print them to console AND also load them to another MySQL table with comments on why it's blocked.

SQL
---
(1) Write MySQL query to find IPs that mode more than a certain number of requests for a given time period.
Ex: Write SQL to find IPs that made more than 100 requests starting from 2017-01-01.13:00:00 to 2017-01-01.14:00:00.
(2) Write MySQL query to find requests made by a given IP.

SQL ans:
1.) SELECT count(*) as count, ip_address FROM server_log WHERE log_time BETWEEN '2017-01-01.13:00:00' AND '2017-01-01.14:00:00' GROUP BY ip_address HAVING count >= number_of_request
2.) SELECT * FROM server_log WHERE ip_address = {ip_address_value} ORDER_BY log_time ASC

READ ME:
- Project is in maven.
- Config settings are in config.properties file
- Database name is server_ip_log, the dump includes dropping the schema & recreate.
- Sample log file for testing is webserver_logs.txt (file name is set in Config file)
- To build, run cli: mvn clean package assembly:single -> to include the dependencies e.g mysql connector
- The resulting jar are:
  - wallethub.jar -> no dependencies
  - wallethub-jar-with-dependencies -> with dependencies => this is what i use for testing
